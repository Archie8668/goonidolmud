            <h2 class="game-title">The Land of Peace</h2>
            <p class="think">Kittens Game, A Dark Room, Avabur</p>
            <p class="overview">Alone in a vast forest and all you have are an axe and a tent. Chop down trees, dig up stones, harvest plants, hunt wildlife. Build a home in this mysterious forest and use it as a base for further exploration. Find broken robots and fix them to do work for you, increasing your productivity and unlocking new options. Uncover the secrets of the Land of Peace. Maybe that last part isn't so important. But there needs to be an explanation for the robots if we're gonna have them and trust me, we want the robots.</p>
            <p class="basic-gameplay">Click on activity buttons to assign a worker to continuously perform that action. At first you're the only available worker but as you find and activate worker robots, they'll be assignable to tasks so you can do more at once.</p>

            <h2 class="game-title">Explorers</h2>
            <h3 class="co-idea">X</h3>
            <p class="think">Amaranthine, Trimps</p>
            <p class="overview">There's a great big world out there but it's dangerous. Learn a trade in the only city on the frontier, earn some money, purchase or produce equipment, and go out on expeditions to get even richer. Explore randomly-generated dungeons, fight enemies, discover precious resources and treasure, and even pick up some lore. Managing the logistics of getting there and back again is just as important as knowing how to stab things to death, so don't skimp on the rations and blankets. Multiplayer hook: Craft for your friends and have an offline progress system where people can recruit a copy of you as a hireling and you get a share of the loot and exp.</p>

        <section class="game-idea" id="star-lords">
            <h2 class="game-title">Star Lords</h2>
            <p class="think">Amaranthine but in space</p>
            <p class="overview">Citizen-crew member in a worldship and its fleet of escorts, flying through space while plundering star systems and fighting hostile aliens. Contribute to the operation of the fleet and thus to its glorious victories. Work and level up to escape from drudgery and become a great engineer, scientist, adventurer, soldier, pilot, or officer. Join a battalion and participate in expeditions to explore strange worlds, fly a freighter to a gas giant to collect hydrogen, or man the turret of a battleship to protect your people. Multiplayer hook: Battalions are player guilds and they compete to achieve the most during events and outshine their fellow players. Hijinks are also a possibility?</p>
            <p class="basic-gameplay">Perform "actions" that require a certain amount of time as shown by a countdown on the player's screen. Every time the countdownr reaches zero, the action is completed and something happens. Usually, it means the player character made progress on a task and gained experience. Depending on the task other things might happen. Bad things. Good things. Action availability depends on player character location, skill, equipment, etc. The game begins with you in a ready room, on your first day as a crew member. You can try fixing the guts of the worldship (engineering), working the soil in hydroponics (science), patrolling the decks looking for problems and goodies (adventure), keeping peace in a bar or rec room (soldiering), or assisting a navigator of probes (piloting). As your character gains levels in skills, they will be directed towards more challenging activities suitable to their level.</p>

        <section class="game-idea" id="wizard-tower-simulator">
            <h2 class="game-title">Wizard Tower Simulator</h2>
            <h3 class="co-idea">X</h3>
            <p class="think">Sim Tower, 4X games</p>
            <p class="overview">You're a wizard and you're alone, flying over the ocean. Cradled in your arms is a crystal with immense potential. Channel your power into the crystal to raise a basalt tower from the sea floor off the coast of the post-apocalyptic ruins of a vast metropolis. Populate your tower with artifacts, workers, and weapons. Deploy your forces to fight for territory and defeat wild beasts, bandits, and worse. How far can you go in your pursuit of wealth and power?</p>
            <p class="basic-gameplay">There are three main screens for the game. There's the tower screen (a side view), the map screen, and the "power screen" that resembles a Kabbalah tree. The tower screen allows you to see your tower and its inhabitants as they work. You can see furnishings and workshops as well. Subwindows for the tower screen include a personnel manager, a workshop manager, inventory, etc. The map screen is for deploying personnel. Troops are an obvious one, but also explorers, miners, foragers, and even diplomatic teams. Engineering and scientific teams might be a thing, depending on what kind of setting we want.</p>

        <section class="game-idea" id="memento-mori">
            <h2 class="game-title">Memento Mori</h2>
            <h5 class="title-aside">(This is a joke name we might have to change it)</h5>
            <p class="overview">Gothic horror RPG where you lead heroes in fighting evil across a land threatened by the darkness. Bandits and thieves, ghosts and goblins, devils and demons. Assemble teams to banish them to Hell and save the peoples. Prevail by choosing party members who can handle what your expected opponents will use against them. Instead of a typical status effect system, your party has morale and emotions (hence the reference to OMORI). Enemies can inspire fear, anger, or even avarice to control your party. Classes respond differently to different feelings, and some characters will have special abilities while in a certain emotional state. Possible examples: an Exorcist might be resistant to fear and crit more often when attacking ghosts when feeling brave, while a Demon Slayer will become incredibly powerful and frighten corporeal enemies when enraged. Adventurers can spot traps in dungeons and Scholars can analyze treasure to recognize blessed or cursed artifacts.</p>
            <p class="basic-gameplay">You start in "town" where you can check your roster; buy, sell, or craft equipment; or look at missions. Missions can be as simple as standing guard overnight, patrolling around the outskirts, or escorting a caravan. Harder missions involve ruins explorations and dungeon dives.</p>

            <h2 class="game-title">Village Builder</h2>
            <h5 class="title-aside">This title is awful</h5>
            <h3 class="co-idea">X</h3>
            <p class="overview">A natural(?)(???)(?!?!?!) disaster messed up your medieval fantasy village pretty badly and the lord you served as an advisor totally bit it when a rock fell on him. Everybody trusts you regardless so take charge as the mayor to rebuild and re-establish contact with the outside world and then the royal capital. And then you find things are bad all over.Multiplayer hook: Make friends with other mayors to help each other and contribute towards grand projects in the royal capital for rewards and regal regard.</p>

            <h2 class="game-title">Some Game With Elemental Affinity or Humours We Never Did Figure That Out</h2>
            <h5 class="title-aside">Another game with a bad title</h5>
            <h3 class="co-idea">X</h3>
            <p class="overview">Medieval Fantasy game where you harvest stuff, but you have some kind of elemental affinity system? And fatigue? So your experience sucks if you do the same activity for too long? I don't remember if this ever turned into a full-fledged game idea. I think there was something about every player being a wizard and you're trying to build a tower for yourself. You'd probably choose between being balanced so you can be versatile and mostly self-sufficient, or specializing in one element so you can be the best at activities involving that element. Multiplayer hook: People can trade or share the things they're best at getting.</p>

            <h2 class="game-title">Let's Ragnarock!</h2>
            <h5 class="title-aside">Not a great title but I like the tone it conveys</h5>
            <p class="overview">You're Odin and you need to prepare for the war to end all wars. Build up your mead hall, recruit valkyries to collect the spirits of warriors, train them up and equip them. The prestige system involves fighting Ragnarok proper and getting better rewards as you progress further and reset. Possible extended prestige idea: What if you decided to tilt the odds in your favor by delaying the end? Progress through history to bring in more warriors or more advanced technology to help you in the final fight.</p>
